# Rubik's Cube Website

This is a website featuring a rotating 3D Rubik's Cube on scroll, with login and sign-up authentication.

## Installation

To run this website locally, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Node.js (including npm)
- Vite
- MongoDB

You can install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
### Vite

You can install Vite globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g create-vite
```

### Getting Started

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can get started with the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rubiks-cube-website.git

```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd rubiks-cube-website
```
Install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Start the MongoDB server:
```bash
npm install

```

Start the website using nodemon (requires nodemon to be installed globally):
```bash
nodemon src/index.js

```
Alternatively, you can start the website without nodemon using:
```bash
node src/index.js

```
```sql

This structure separates the installation steps (Node.js, Vite, MongoDB) from the "Getting Started" section, making it clear where users should focus depending on whether they are setting up the environment or running the project.
